I am currently a Ph.D. student at Electronic Information School of Wuhan University, China, under the supervision of Prof. [Jiayi Ma](http://mvp.whu.edu.cn/jiayima/) in the [Lab of Multi-spectral Vision Processing](http://mvp.whu.edu.cn/). I received my B.Eng from Wuhan University, China, in 2018.

My research interests include topics in computer vision, especially image fusion, image enhancement, and multi-modal data processing.
